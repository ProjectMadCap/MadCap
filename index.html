<a id="our-goal" class="anchor" href="#our-goal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Goal.</h3>

<p>Our goal with this product is to open communication between the parent and teacher on how their child is doing in their class. This product is intended for 5th grade and below where the teacher only teaches one class throughout the day and can give the parent the most up-to-date information.</p>

<p>We all know most things that are given to the child to bring home rarely make it -- unless it's good.</p>

<h3>
<a id="classwork" class="anchor" href="#classwork" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Classwork</h3>

<p>Growing up, our parents knew almost nothing of what was going on in school and what we were learning. We want to open communication on what the child is learning in school and allow the parent to help in the teaching process.</p>

<h3>
<a id="behaviors" class="anchor" href="#behaviors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Behaviors</h3>

<p>Not only do we want the parent to know how their kid is acting in class. Not only sharing the bad but also the good.</p>
